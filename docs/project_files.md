# Project Files

The configuration of `reccmp` requires three different files. As explained in the [main README](../README.md), `reccmp-project` can be used to generate each of them.

* `reccmp-project.yml` contains the main configuration. We recommend that you keep this file at the root of your repository and add it to your VCS (like `git`).
* `reccmp-user.yml` contains information that may differ from user to user, like the location of the original binary files. We recommend that you ignore this file from your VCS and keep it at the root of your repository.
* `reccmp-build.yml` contains information that may differ in each recompilation, like the location of the recompiled binary and debug symbol file. We recommend that you ignore this file from your VCS.
  * If the names or paths of your build artifacts change, we recommend you generate this script as part of your build process.
  * If they do not, you can generate this file once and keep it in your build directory or at the repository root.
  * Note that as of this writing, the Ghidra import needs to have a `reccmp-build.yml` at the repository root.


## Additional information in `reccmp-project.yml`

> See the relevant [Python file](../reccmp/project/config.py) in case this documentation is outdated.

Some additional information can be added to `reccmp-project.yml` by hand. For example:
```yml
targets:
  BETA10:
    filename: BETA10.DLL
    source-root: LEGO1
    hash:
      sha256: ...
    ghidra:
      ignore-types:
        - Act2Actor
      ignore-functions:
        - 0x100f8ad0
```
This tells the Ghidra import script to ignore certain types and functions.
